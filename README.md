# Portfolio — Rohith Pranov

A cinematic, scroll-driven personal portfolio built on Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, GSAP ScrollTrigger, Framer Motion, Lenis smooth-scroll, Three.js / Spline, and a handful of custom WebGL shaders. Designed to read like an editorial spread on desktop and to keep its rhythm intact on mobile, with every section choreographed against a single scroll timeline.

The site is deliberately heavy on motion and light on chrome: there is no navigation bar, no fold; the experience is the scroll. Each "chapter" introduces itself with a full-bleed curtain, plays a dedicated micro-scene, and hands the user off to the next chapter via a custom transition (warp portal, fold, zoom-parallax, tilted grid).

## Live deploy

Deployed on Vercel from the `main` branch. Push-to-deploy. Static prerendering for the single route (`/`) plus on-demand image optimization through `next/image`.

## What's on the page

The single route at `/` is composed of these scenes, in order, all rendered as static HTML on first paint and progressively hydrated:

1. **`FrameToFullscreen` → `VSCodePortfolio`**
   GSAP pin + perspective tilt that lifts a miniature VS Code window from the page and flattens it into the viewport. The IDE is a full replica — Mac OS menu bar, activity bar, explorer with a working `FileTree`, tabs, editor, right rail with `ProjectModal` cards driven by real project data, an animated `TextType` headline, and an embedded Apple-style `SpotlightSearch` (`⌘K`).

2. **`ScrollRevealCurtain` → `SplineSceneBasic`**
   A black curtain peels away to reveal a Spline 3D scene with a `Spotlight` sweep. The Spline runtime is lazy-loaded behind an `IntersectionObserver` so the ~2 MB WebAssembly bundle never ships until the section is scrolled into view.

3. **`StoryScrollDemo`**
   "About" chapter — long-form copy revealed through scroll-pinned typographic panels (`story-scroll.tsx`) with a `prefers-reduced-motion` opt-out.

4. **`ScrollWarpPortal`** (Chapter 02 — The Showcase)
   Pinned section where text warps through a portal effect.

5. **`HeroParallaxDemo` → `HeroParallax`**
   Three horizontally-translating rows of project cards driven by `useScroll` + `useSpring`. Real project thumbnails (KodaiRateIQ, ProofStack, CyberShield India, etc.) link out to live deploys.

6. **`ScrollMorphSection` → `ScrollMorphHero`**
   Scatter → line → circle → bottom-strip flip-card morph animation cycling through every project image.

7. **`ScrollFoldTransition`** (Chapter 03 — Designed with Intent)
   Origami-style fold transition between sections.

8. **`ScrollTiltedGridDemo` → `ScrollTiltedGrid`**
   Each tile is a `motion` element with its own `useScroll`-driven blur, brightness, contrast, and 3D tilt. Backed by a starfield + dotted-grid + radial gold glow backdrop.

9. **`CardCarouselDemo`** with `LightRays` backdrop
   Design portfolio carousel with a custom ogl-based fragment shader projecting low-saturation gold rays from the top of the section.

10. **`ZoomParallaxDemo` → `ZoomParallax`**
    Sticky 300vh container where seven images zoom independently into the viewport on a single scroll arc.

11. **`ProfileCard`** (Contact)
    Tilted holographic business card with pointer-tracked shine, mini avatar, status pill, and a LinkedIn CTA.

12. **`FooterDemo` → `Footer`**
    Brand mark, social grid (LinkedIn, Resume, GitHub, Mail), nav row, and a giant blurred wordmark backdrop.

A global `MouseFollower` (dual-spring cursor) and a `PageReveal` curtain animate over the whole experience, and a `SmoothScrollProvider` (Lenis) drives the page's scroll.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ (Next.js 16 dropped Node 18)
- pnpm 9+ (the repo ships a `pnpm-lock.yaml` and a `pnpm-workspace.yaml`)

### Install

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Local development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. Turbopack is the default in Next.js 16; HMR is wired through `next dev`. Edit `app/page.tsx` and any imported scene to iterate live.

### Production build

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

`pnpm build` runs Turbopack-powered production compilation, type-checks the project with `tsc --noEmit` (via Next), collects route data, and prerenders the single `/` route to static HTML. The output is in `.next/`.

### Lint

```bash
pnpm lint
```

ESLint flat config layers `eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals` and `eslint-config-next/typescript`. Lint is decoupled from `next build` (so an in-flight stylistic warning does not block deploys), but the type checker still runs during build and will fail the build on any TS error.

## Architecture decisions

### Single scroll timeline

The whole experience is driven by one source of truth for time:

- `useLenis` ([`hooks/useLenis.ts`](hooks/useLenis.ts)) instantiates Lenis with `duration: 1.2`, an exponential-ease wheel, and pipes its `scroll` event straight into `ScrollTrigger.update`.
- The Lenis RAF loop is registered with `gsap.ticker.add(tick)` — *the same `tick` reference is removed in cleanup* (early commits had a leak here where `gsap.ticker.add` and `gsap.ticker.remove` were given different inline closures, so the RAF survived hot-reloads).
- Every animated section uses GSAP ScrollTrigger or Framer Motion's `useScroll`, both reading from `window.scrollY`, which Lenis now owns. There is no second scroll loop anywhere.

### Code splitting

- The root `app/page.tsx` is a **Server Component**. Every interactive scene is a Client Component (`"use client"`) imported into it. Next.js automatically code-splits each client component into its own chunk.
- The Spline runtime (~2 MB compressed, includes WebAssembly for physics + opentype) is wrapped in [`splite.tsx`](components/ui/splite.tsx) with `React.lazy()` + `<Suspense>`. The Spline scene component then guards its render behind an `IntersectionObserver` so the runtime is not even *fetched* until the user scrolls to it.
- `next.config.ts` declares `experimental.optimizePackageImports` for `framer-motion`, `gsap`, `lucide-react`, `@radix-ui/*`, `@react-three/drei`, and `lenis` — only the named exports actually used get bundled.

### Image pipeline

- `next/image` is used for every non-decorative image, with explicit `sizes` matched to the actual visual width.
- `next.config.ts` declares `formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp']` and tuned `deviceSizes` / `imageSizes` arrays, so the heavy PNGs (`oldportfolio-1.png` at 4.5 MB, `profilecard.png` at 4.1 MB) stream as AVIF/WebP at viewport size rather than as raw PNG.
- A response-header rule applies `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` to fonts and images.

### Fonts

- Two `next/font/google` families: Cormorant Garamond (display, weights 400/500) and DM Sans (body, weights 400/500/600). Both with `display: 'swap'`.
- Cormorant has `preload: false` because it appears only in a handful of card titles — eagerly preloading every weight blocks the critical font request for DM Sans.

### Cursor & input

- `MouseFollower` ([`components/animations/MouseFollower.tsx`](components/animations/MouseFollower.tsx)) uses Framer Motion springs for the outer ring and an inner dot at different stiffness, blended with `mix-blend-difference`.
- It detects coarse pointers via `matchMedia('(pointer: coarse)')` in a `useEffect` (no SSR mismatches) and short-circuits the whole component on touch devices.
- Hover-state tracking uses **document-level event delegation** (`mouseover` / `mouseout` with `e.target.closest(...)`) rather than per-element listeners, so links and buttons added later in the scroll lifecycle (modals, spotlight results, project cards) get the hover treatment automatically without re-scanning the DOM.
- The `mousemove` listener is registered with `{ passive: true }`.

### Mailto / external links

- The footer and the `⌘K` spotlight detect protocol URLs (`mailto:`, `tel:`, `sms:`) and render plain `<a>` without `target="_blank"`. The earlier behavior — `target="_blank"` on a `mailto:` — opens a blank tab that the OS then tries to redirect, which Safari and some Chromium builds drop silently.

### Security headers

`next.config.ts` sets:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control: on`
- `poweredByHeader: false`

### Reduced motion

`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is honored where motion is critical: `story-scroll.tsx` reads the media query and disables transforms, `scroll-tilted-grid.tsx` swaps to a static layout via Framer's `useReducedMotion`, and the starfield in the tilted grid CSS animation pauses.

## Deployment (Vercel)

The project is configured to deploy zero-config on Vercel:

1. Connect the GitHub repo (`Rohithpranov07/Portfolio-cinematic`) to a Vercel project.
2. Framework preset: **Next.js** (auto-detected).
3. Install command: `pnpm install` (auto).
4. Build command: `pnpm build` (auto).
5. Output: `.next/` (auto).
6. Set the `metadataBase` in `app/layout.tsx` to your final deploy URL for correct OG image resolution.

Static pages prerender at build time; `next/image` requests are served via Vercel's edge image optimizer.

---

## Conventions

- All scene components use a `"use client"` directive at the top.
- Server-only logic stays in `app/page.tsx` and `app/layout.tsx`.
- Animations register on `useLayoutEffect` (to avoid flicker) and clean up via `gsap.context()`.
- GSAP ScrollTriggers are created inside `gsap.context()` blocks so they're collected and disposed together on unmount.
- Class-name composition goes through [`lib/utils.ts`](lib/utils.ts) `cn()` (clsx + tailwind-merge).
- Path alias `@/*` resolves to the project root (see `tsconfig.json`).

---

## Known constraints

- The site is desktop-first by design — many scenes (the VS Code IDE, Spline 3D, the horizontal hero parallax) are authored at a 1440-wide canvas. They render on mobile but the design is not flowed for it.
- `metadataBase` in `app/layout.tsx` currently points at a placeholder Vercel URL; update before going to a custom domain so Open Graph image URLs resolve correctly.
